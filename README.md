# basepaint
The main goal of this repository is to be an archive for the art generated by the [basepaint.xyz](https://basepaint.xyz/) community.

# Howto
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:isaacbernat/basepaint.git`
2. Move into the newly created directory: `cd basepaint`
3. [Get python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install dependencies:
    ```python
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Create the archive: `python3 create_archive.py`
    This will create the following files:
    - `images/`: directory containing the images in .jpg format for the archive.
    - `metadata.csv`: csv file containing metadata for each image.
    - `basepaint_archive.pdf`: pdf with the archive in book format.

# Why this repo?
I couldn't find a convenient way to access the artworks generated by the [basepaint.xyz](https://basepaint.xyz/) community, especially offline and/or in pdf/printable format. I created this collection of tools to make it easier to access, share and promote the art created by the community.
